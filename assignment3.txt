1. Explain what is prototype and what is prototype chain in your own words

	Prototype in JS is an object, and every object has prototype in its core. If any
	object's functions and variables are attached to object then it can also be derived into
	the prototype as well. Like class inheritance objects can be inheritance from one to
	another object using prototype.


	Prototype chaining is like inheritance process of passing functions and variables from
	parent to child, like wise chaining enables object prototype to inherit from parent 
	object.
